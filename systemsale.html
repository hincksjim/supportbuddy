<p><strong>Support Buddy</strong> is a revolutionary application designed to be your private, intelligent, and compassionate partner through every step of your health journey. It&#39;s more than just an app; it&#39;s your personal support system, available 24/7, right on your own device.</p>

<h2>✨ Core Features: What Makes Support Buddy Special?</h2>
<h3>🤝 Your Personal AI Support Team</h3>
<p>Imagine having a team of specialists dedicated to you. With Support Buddy, you do. Choose your preferred avatar and communication style for each of your three AI companions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your Medical Expert:</strong> Get clear, simple explanations about your condition, treatments, and medical terminology.</li>
<li><strong>Your Mental Health Nurse:</strong> A safe, empathetic space to talk about your feelings, worries, and anxieties.</li>
<li><strong>Your Financial Support Specialist:</strong> Receive guidance on managing finances, understanding benefits, and finding support grants.</li>
</ul>
<h3>💬 Intelligent Support Chat</h3>
<p>This is the heart of Support Buddy. Have natural, supportive conversations with your AI team. They remember your entire journey—your diagnosis, your treatments, your diary entries, and your previous conversations—to provide truly personalized and context-aware support.</p>
<h3>📄 AI Document Analysis</h3>
<p>Feeling overwhelmed by medical reports? Simply upload a photo or PDF of a blood test result, scan report, or clinic letter. Ask a question in plain English, and your AI Medical Expert will provide a structured, easy-to-understand summary, defining complex terms and highlighting the key information for you.</p>
<h3>💊 Smart Medication Management</h3>
<p>Stay on top of your prescriptions with ease.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Log a New Medication:</strong> Manually enter your prescription details or simply use your device&#39;s camera to take a photo of the medication box—the AI will read the name, strength, and dosage for you.</li>
<li><strong>AI Medication Analysis:</strong> For each new medication, the AI provides a simple summary of its use, lists common side effects, and, most importantly, <strong>checks for potential interactions</strong> with your other logged medications, providing a clear warning if a risk is detected.</li>
<li><strong>Dose Tracking:</strong> When you log a medication in your daily diary, the app cross-references it with your prescribed dose to warn you if you&#39;re about to exceed the recommended daily maximum.</li>
</ul>
<h3>🥗 AI-Powered Dietary &amp; Weight Management</h3>
<p>Take control of your nutrition with powerful, integrated tools designed to support your health goals.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Effortless Calorie Counting:</strong> Forget manual entry. Just take a photo of your meal, and the AI will identify the food, estimate the portion size, and provide a calorie count and a list of ingredients.</li>
<li><strong>Personalized Health Targets:</strong> Based on your profile details (age, height, weight), the app calculates your BMI and sets a healthy target weight range and a recommended daily calorie intake to help you achieve it.</li>
<li><strong>Intelligent Feedback:</strong> When you log a meal, the daily calorie total on your diary card will turn red if you exceed your target, providing instant, actionable feedback. The AI also analyzes your meal&#39;s ingredients against your diagnosis to provide gentle warnings (e.g., high sodium for kidney disease).</li>
<li><strong>Tailored Meal Suggestions:</strong> Receive a library of AI-generated meal and snack ideas tailored specifically to your health condition(s), complete with recipes, calorie counts, and estimated costs.</li>
<li><strong>Meal Planner &amp; Shopping List:</strong> Add suggested meals to a weekly planner and automatically generate a categorized shopping list for the week, making healthy eating easier than ever.</li>
</ul>
<h3>📓 Your Daily Wellness Diary &amp; Health Dashboard</h3>
<p>Your private space to track what matters, day by day.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Comprehensive Logging:</strong> Log your mood, pain scores, symptoms, weight, sleep, and condition-specific metrics like blood pressure or fluid intake.</li>
<li><strong>Symptom Pattern Analysis:</strong> If you log a recurring symptom, the AI can analyze your diary entries, medications, and diagnosis to identify potential connections or causes, helping you have more informed conversations with your doctor.</li>
*   **Voice Notes:** Can&#39;t type? Record a voice note, and the app will **transcribe it to text** and provide a concise AI-generated summary.</li>
<li><strong>Note Taking &amp; Calendar:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Calendar:</strong> Schedule and manage all your upcoming medical appointments in one place.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Finance Hub:</strong> Get a clear overview of your financial situation based on the information you&#39;ve provided.</li>

<li><strong>Benefits Checker:</strong> Explore your potential eligibility for various benefits in different life scenarios, such as stopping work or becoming a carer.</li>
</ul>
<h3>📝 Comprehensive Personal Summary</h3>
<p>Your entire journey, in one place. With a single click, the app&#39;s most powerful AI agent will read and synthesize information from <em>every part of the app</em>—your profile, documents, chats, diary, and timeline—to create a comprehensive, organized report, complete with citations. It&#39;s the perfect document to prepare for a consultation or simply review your progress.</p>
<h3>🤫 The &quot;Just In Case&quot; Vault</h3>
<p>For your peace of mind. This is a completely private and secure space on your device to record important final wishes, practical instructions, and messages for loved ones. This information is for you and your family, and is never shared or analyzed.</p>

<h2>🔐 Your Privacy is Our Priority</h2>
