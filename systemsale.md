Your entire journey, in one place. With a single click, the app's most powerful AI agent will read and synthesize information from *every part of the app*—your profile, documents, chats, diary, and timeline—to create a comprehensive, organized report. It's perfect for preparing for a consultation or simply reviewing your progress.

Track what matters, day by day. Your private diary allows you to log:

### 💊 Smart Medication Management

Stay on top of your prescriptions. Log the medications you're taking, and let the AI provide you with a simple summary of what each one is for, list common side effects, and—most importantly—warn you about potential interactions between them.

### 🥗 AI-Powered Dietary Support

Eating well is a crucial part of your journey.
*   **Health Targets:** The app calculates your BMI and provides personalized targets for a healthy weight range and daily calorie intake.
*   **Meal Suggestions:** Get AI-generated meal and snack ideas tailored specifically to your health condition and dietary needs.
