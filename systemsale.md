### 📄 AI Document Analysis

Feeling overwhelmed by medical reports? Simply upload a photo or PDF of a blood test result, scan report, or clinic letter. Ask a question in plain English, and your AI Medical Expert will provide a structured, easy-to-understand summary, defining complex terms and highlighting the key information for you.

### 💊 Smart Medication Management

Stay on top of your prescriptions with ease.
*   **Log a New Medication:** Manually enter your prescription details or simply use your device's camera to take a photo of the medication box—the AI will read the name, strength, and dosage for you.
*   **AI Medication Analysis:** For each new medication, the AI provides a simple summary of its use, lists common side effects, and, most importantly, **checks for potential interactions** with your other logged medications, providing a clear warning if a risk is detected.
*   **Dose Tracking:** When you log a medication in your daily diary, the app cross-references it with your prescribed dose to warn you if you're about to exceed the recommended daily maximum.

### 🥗 AI-Powered Dietary & Weight Management

Take control of your nutrition with powerful, integrated tools designed to support your health goals.

*   **Personalized Health Targets:** Based on your profile details (age, height, weight), the app calculates your BMI and sets a healthy target weight range and a recommended daily calorie intake to help you achieve it.
*   **Intelligent Feedback:** When you log a meal, the daily calorie total on your diary card will turn red if you exceed your target, providing instant, actionable feedback. The AI also analyzes your meal's ingredients against your diagnosis to provide gentle warnings (e.g., high sodium for kidney disease).
*   **Tailored Meal Suggestions:** Receive a library of AI-generated meal and snack ideas tailored specifically to your health condition(s), complete with recipes, calorie counts, and estimated costs.
